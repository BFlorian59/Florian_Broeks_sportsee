Then regarding data, the NodeJS backend you can find [here](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard). It will allow you to make your HTTP calls and retrieve sample data. Everything is described there: the installation steps as well as the HTTP calls that I put in place.
