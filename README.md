# SportSee : page profile

SportSee, a startup dedicated to sports coaching. In full growth, the company will today launch a new version of the user profile page. This page will in particular allow the user to follow the number of sessions carried out as well as the number of calories burned.

## Install Back-End

Regarding the data, I created a backend using NodeJS that you can find [here](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard). It will allow you to make your HTTP calls and retrieve sample data. Everything is described there: the installation steps as well as the HTTP calls that I have put in place.
